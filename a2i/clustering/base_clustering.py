        Cluster objects based on their centroids.
        
        Args:
            object_centroids: List of tuples, each containing:
                - lat (float): Latitude of object centroid
                - lon (float): Longitude of object centroid
                - obj_points: Original map points (QgsPointXY objects)

        Returns:
            labels: List of integers, one per object, indicating cluster membership.
                   Objects in the same cluster have the same label.
                   Labels should start from 0 and be consecutive.
        
        Example:
            If you have 5 objects that form 2 clusters:
            - Objects 0, 1, 2 are in cluster 0
            - Objects 3, 4 are in cluster 1
            Then return: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
